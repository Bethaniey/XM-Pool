# XM-Pool
XM-pool is the system that will be introduced in this project. XM-pool is a system that mainly focuses on providing carpooling and ‘foodpooling’ services to all the students and staffs inside Xiamen University Malaysia campus. Since the campus is covering around 1,500 acres of opened land, students sometimes might find that it is too tiring or time consuming for them to walk to the destinations. In addition, during monsoon season, students might skip class due to the extreme weather condition. To cope with all these problem, XM-pool system is introduced into the campus to solve the problems.
